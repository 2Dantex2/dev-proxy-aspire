## Introduction

Dev Proxy Aspire allows developers to enhance their distributed applications with robust proxy capabilities. It supports API testing, chaos engineering, and resilience patterns. This tool is designed to simplify development workflows, making it easier to manage HTTP requests and responses.

## Features

- **API Testing**: Validate your APIs effortlessly.
- **Chaos Engineering**: Introduce failures to test system resilience.
- **Mock Server**: Simulate API endpoints for testing.
- **OpenAPI Support**: Generate API documentation and client libraries.
- **Integration with Microsoft 365**: Leverage Microsoft tools in your development.
- **HTTP Proxy**: Route requests and responses seamlessly.
- **Resilience Patterns**: Implement retry logic and circuit breakers.

## Installation

To get started with Dev Proxy Aspire, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/2Dantex2/dev-proxy-aspire.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd dev-proxy-aspire
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. Build the project:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

5. Run the application:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## Usage

To use Dev Proxy Aspire, you need to configure your application settings. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to set it up:

1. Open your `appsettings.json` file and add the proxy settings:

   ```json
   {
     "ProxySettings": {
       "BaseUrl": "http://localhost:5000",
       "Timeout": 30
     }
   }
   ```

2. In your application code, initialize the proxy:

   ```csharp
   var proxy = new DevProxy(options);
   ```

3. Make API calls through the proxy:

   ```csharp
   var response = await proxy.CallAsync("GET", "/api/data");
   ```
